# BIOMETRIC BASED AUTHENTIFICATION IN ATM
```
•	Implemented a highly-secured ATM application using Iris image of individual user to authenticate transactions 			securely.
•	Digital image processing algorithms like canny edge detection and Hough’s circle detection algorithm for parsing the 	 iris image for authentication with the use of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), MD5 hashing for client and server-side 	   validations.
•	Pulished a research paper in Machine learning for authentificating users based on IRIS titled under “Secure Banking 	Based on Machine Learning in IRIS Pattern Recognition” in International Journal of Control Theory and Applications. 	ISSN: 0974-5572
